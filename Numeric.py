#Python follows the PEMDAS rule which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right) for calculation of an expression.


#Arithmetic Operators
Addition = 10 + 5
Subtraction = 10 - 5
Multiplication = 10 * 5
Division = 10 / 5
Modulus = 10 % 3
Exponent = 10 ** 5
FloorDivision = 10 // 3


I=10
#Increment 
I+=1 
#Decrement  
I-=1
